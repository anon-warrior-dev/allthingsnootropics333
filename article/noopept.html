      <!-- Overview -->
      <section id="overview" class="section">
        <h2>Quick overview — what Noopept does and why it matters</h2>
        <p>Noopept (N-phenylacetyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester) is a small, synthetic peptide-inspired cognitive compound developed in Russia. While it is often compared to racetams, Noopept is pharmacologically distinct: it works effectively in microdoses (typically <strong>10–30 mg</strong>), supports neuroplasticity (BDNF & NGF), optimizes glutamatergic signaling (AMPA/NMDA modulation), and shows neuroprotective properties. In short: Noopept focuses on improving how the brain learns, stores, and retrieves information — and on preserving neural resilience over time.</p>

        <p class="note">Why microdosing matters: the potency-per-milligram makes Noopept a precision tool — fast-acting, subtle, and less likely to produce stimulant-esque side effects when used responsibly.</p>

      <!-- History and context -->
      <section id="history" class="section">
        <h2>Origins & historical context</h2>
        <p>Noopept was synthesized in the 1990s in Russia and was inspired by the endogenous peptide cycloprolylglycine (CPG), a molecule implicated in memory facilitation. The compound sits at the intersection of peptide research and traditional nootropics: built to be efficient, low-dose, and oriented toward long-term neural outcomes rather than brute stimulation. Over the past three decades, users and researchers have focused on its effects on memory consolidation, neuroprotection, and emotional stability.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Mechanisms -->
      <section id="mechanisms" class="section">
        <h2>How Noopept works — mechanisms explained</h2>

        <h3>1) Glutamate receptor optimization (AMPA & NMDA)</h3>
        <p>Noopept fine-tunes glutamatergic signaling. Instead of indiscriminately boosting glutamate, it modulates AMPA and NMDA receptor function in ways that support synaptic plasticity while lowering excitotoxic risk. Practically, that means cleaner information transfer during learning, improved long-term potentiation (LTP), and less neural “noise.”</p>

        <h3>2) Neurotrophic support — BDNF and NGF</h3>
        <p>One of Noopept’s most valuable effects is upregulating neurotrophic factors (BDNF & NGF). These proteins are the brain’s growth signals: they support synaptic remodeling, dendritic branching, and the formation of new memory traces. Over months, this supports not just faster learning but more durable memory storage.</p>

        <h3>3) Neuroprotection & cellular resilience</h3>
        <p>Noopept exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in preclinical studies, stabilizes intracellular calcium, and protects mitochondria. This makes it attractive as a long-term cognitive adjunct for users concerned about brain aging and cumulative stress.</p>

        <h3>4) Subtle mood & anxiety benefits</h3>
        <p>Many users report reductions in baseline anxiety and emotional reactivity. The likely mechanisms include improved glutamate balance, mild dopamine receptor modulation, and lower neuroinflammation — all of which help the brain respond to stress with less volatility.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Dosing -->
      <section id="dosing" class="section">
        <h2>Dosing, timing & practical protocols</h2>
        <p>Because Noopept is potent, dosing prudence is essential. Typical dosing patterns used by experienced users:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microdose maintenance:</strong> 10 mg once daily (taken with food or on an empty stomach depending on tolerance).</li>
          <li><strong>Standard range:</strong> 10–30 mg/day (split into 2 doses if using higher end).</li>
          <li><strong>Loading is unnecessary:</strong> Unlike some compounds, Noopept’s benefits are not improved by multi-gram loading; consistency matters more than high acute doses.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Monitoring & adjusting:</strong> start at 10 mg for 7–14 days, evaluate clarity, sleep, and mood, then adjust slowly. If you experience headaches or mild cognitive fog, evaluate choline support (Alpha-GPC or CDP-choline) and hydration.</p>

        <div class="protocol" style="margin-top:12px;">
          <strong>Beginner protocol (4 weeks):</strong> 10 mg daily for week 1 → 10 mg morning + 10 mg early afternoon week 2 if tolerated → evaluate benefits at week 4.

      <!-- Stacks -->
      <section id="stacks" class="section">
        <h2>Top Noopept stacks — what pairs well</h2>
        <p>Noopept integrates smoothly into many stacks. Keep combinations simple and test one change at a time.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Noopept + Alpha-GPC (300–600 mg):</strong> supports acetylcholine for verbal fluency and memory encoding.</li>
          <li><strong>Noopept + Lion's Mane (500–1000 mg daily):</strong> synergizes for neurotrophic support and long-term plasticity.</li>
          <li><strong>Noopept + L-Theanine (100 mg as needed):</strong> smooths focus and reduces subtle anxiety spikes.</li>
          <li><strong>Noopept + Magnesium (chelate form):</strong> supports neural stability and sleep quality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">Avoid mixing multiple stimulatory agents at once — Noopept is best when other elements of the stack are supporting nutrition, cholinergic tone, and mitochondria.</p>

      <section id="benefits" class="section">
        <h2>Practical benefits & real-world use cases</h2>
        <p>Noopept is prized for several practical use cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Deep study & revision:</strong> improved retention and recall across repeated study sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Creative work & writing:</strong> clearer pattern recognition and smoother verbal output.</li>

      <!-- Safety -->
      <section id="safety" class="section">
        <h2>Safety, side effects, and clinical cautions</h2>
        <p>Noopept is generally well tolerated when used responsibly. Important precautions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Avoid high doses and unnecessary experimentation — microdoses are effective.</li>
          <li>Individuals with active cancer should avoid peptide-like nootropics until cleared by oncology professionals.</li>
          <li>Pregnancy & breastfeeding: avoid unless supervised by a clinician (limited safety data).</li>
          <li>Interactions: if you take prescription medicines (esp. psychiatric drugs), check with a clinician before combining.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="note">If you experience headaches, brain fog, or sleep disturbances, reevaluate dose, timing, and choline support. Always keep a record of your subjective response when testing nootropics.</p>
